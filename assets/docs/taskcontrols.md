# Taskcontrols

Workflow Automation Library with support for Concurrent or Event based processes or activities in Local/Network Automation Tasks, including CI/CD activities.

* taskcontrol (py-taskcontrol) is a python library to create tasks in and based on named taskflow controls. It allows middlewares before and after each task with support for concurrent processing. taskcontrol can run single or multiple tasks during task invocation/runs.
* It provides a simple decorator called task that takes arguments to set up the named taskflow controls. It also provides methods to create a plugin and allow working with tasks as a module and/or pre-created ordered task list. Taskcontrol allows for scaling of plugin development with various utilities like authentication, logging, concurrency, sockets, events, publisher-subscriber architectures, webhooks, client-server http api servers etc.
