# CGIJS

CGIJS is a library to run any CGI / Interpreted language script files, or connect to any web application server proxies, or manage processes in the system.

Supports running any CGI / Interpreted Language scripts in any OS that runs node.js. Supports both CGI executables as well as proxy to localhost/ remote /embedded servers using proxying.

CGIJS was created with a motivation to allow creation of a Desktop executable/ application using Electron that can run any CGI / Interpreted language scripted files/ applications under the hood.

`npm install cgijs --save`
